</p><p align="center"><b>I.</b> 
</p><p> 

</p><p>The Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") deems it 
appropriate that cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, 
instituted pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934 ("Exchange Act") against Respondent Mercator Software, Inc. 
("Mercator").

</p><p> 
</p><p align="center"><b>II.</b> 
</p><p> 

</p><p>In anticipation of the institution of these cease-and-desist 
proceedings, Mercator has submitted an Offer of Settlement ("Offer") 
which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the purpose of
 these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of 
the Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without 
admitting or denying the findings contained herein, except as to the 
Commission's jurisdiction over it and the subject matter of these 
proceedings, Mercator consents to the entry of this Order Instituting 
Cease-and-Desist Proceedings, Making Findings and Imposing 
Cease-and-Desist Order ("Order") as set forth below.

</p><p align="center"><b>III.</b>

</p><p>On the basis of this Order and the Offer, the Commission finds that:

</p><p><b>A. <u>RESPONDENT</u></b>
</p><p>          Mercator is a Delaware corporation with its principal 
place of business in Wilton, Connecticut.  Mercator was incorporated in 
Connecticut in 1985 as TSI International Software, Inc. and 
reincorporated in Delaware in September 1993.  The company changed its 
name to Mercator, effective April 3, 2000.  At all relevant times, 
Mercator's securities were traded on the NASDAQ National Market and 
registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange
 Act, and the company was required to file reports with the Commission 
pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act.
</p><p><b>B. <u>SUMMARY</u></b>

</p><p>This matter involves material understatements of expenses in 
Mercator's publicly released financial statements for the first and 
second quarters of 2000.<sup><a href="#P46_2338" name="P46_2339">1</a></sup>
  During those quarters, Mercator failed to record certain expenses in 
the quarter during which they were incurred, resulting in understated 
losses for both quarters.  This practice understated the extent of 
Mercator's losses and resulted in Mercator's misstating its net losses 
in financial statements filed in its Form 10-Q for the first quarter and
 in its earnings release at the conclusion of the second quarter.  
Mercator's Chief Financial Officer at the time (the "CFO") and 
then-controller (the "Controller") each knew, or were reckless in not 
knowing, that certain expenses were not reported.<a></a><a href="#P47_3035" name="P47_3036">2</a>
  Those certain expenses were excluded in an attempt to meet Wall Street
 analysts' earnings expectations for the two quarters.  On August 21, 
2000, Mercator announced that it had understated expenses for the first 
quarter by $1.3 million and for the second quarter by $1.1 million.  As a
 result of the understated expenses, first quarter net loss,  operating 
loss and loss per share were each understated by 14% and second quarter 
net loss, operating loss and loss per share were each understated by 
10%.  Accordingly, Mercator violated Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) and 
13(B)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13 thereunder. 
    

</p><p>  
</p><p><b>C. <u>FACTS</u></b>

</p><p>Mercator specializes in software which allows businesses to 
integrate different types of systems and applications.  In 1999, 
Mercator's annual revenues were $99 million. Starting in late 1998 
through the end of 1999, Mercator made three substantial acquisitions 
which placed a strain on its operational resources and its internal 
controls.  Although Mercator's business grew substantially as a result 
of the acquisitions, its accounting staff was not correspondingly 
expanded at the time of the acquisitions. 
</p><p>From the time Mercator began publicly trading in 1997 until the 
end of 1999, the company  met analysts' earnings expectations for every 
fiscal quarter.  During the first and second quarters of 2000, the CFO 
placed substantial pressure on the Controller to continue to meet 
analysts' earnings expectations in reported financial results.  As a 
result of that pressure, the Controller intentionally failed to record 
certain operating expenses which were material to both quarters.  The 
CFO was informed of, or was reckless in not knowing of, the 
underreporting in both quarters.<a></a><a href="#P54_5052" name="P54_5053">3</a>  
</p><p>In addition to the CFO and the Controller being aware of the 
underreporting of certain expenses, Mercator also failed to report  
expenses material to both quarters because its internal controls 
relating to expense reporting were inadequate.  In particular, Mercator 
had inadequate procedures in place to ensure accurate and timely 
communication between the accounting department and other areas of the 
company, with the result that certain expenses were not internally 
reported to the accounting department until after the financial 
statements for the period had already been publicly released.         
</p><p><b>1. <u>Failure To Properly Record Expenses in the First Quarter</u></b> 
</p><p>In its Form 10-Q filed on May 15, 2000, Mercator understated 
actual first quarter expenses by approximately $1.3 million.  At the 
time the Form 10-Q was filed, the Controller and the CFO both knew, or 
were reckless in not knowing, that at least $750,000 in first quarter 
expenses had not been included in the financial statements for the first
 quarter.  The balance of the unreported expenses (approximately 
$550,000) was excluded largely as a result of either inadvertence or 
failure of internal controls relating to expense reporting.
</p><p>The unreported $750,000 in first quarter expenses was comprised 
of three categories: (1) legal expenses; (2) bonus expenses; and (3) 
expenses related to a shareholder value study completed in the first 
quarter.  The understatement of legal and bonus expenses began because 
Mercator had inadequate procedures in place for ensuring that its 
accounting department wasinformed of such expenses in a timely manner.  
By the time the Form 10-Q was filed, however, both the CFO and the 
Controller knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that legal expenses 
and bonus expenses were not being adequately tracked by Mercator's 
internal expense reporting systems.  Both also knew, or were reckless in
 not knowing, that Mercator had incurred substantial legal and bonus 
expenses during the first quarter that were not included in the first 
quarter financial statements.  In addition to being aware of the 
unrecorded legal and bonus expenses, both the Controller and the CFO 
knew that a substantial non-recurring expense relating to a shareholder 
value study had been incurred in the first quarter and that the expense 
had not been recorded in the first quarter financial statements.  The 
CFO and the Controller did not include the $750,000 in expenses in 
financial statements filed with the Form 10-Q.  The numbers reported in 
the Form 10-Q allowed the company to meet analysts' expectations.  If 
all first quarter expenses had been reported, Mercator would not have 
met analysts' earnings expectations.  As a result of the total $1.3 
million in excluded expenses, Mercator's first quarter net loss, 
operating loss and loss per share were each understated by 14%.   
</p><p><b>2. <u> Failure to Properly Record Expenses in the Second Quarter</u></b>
</p><p>On July 20, 2000, Mercator announced financial results for the 
second quarter which understated expenses by approximately $1.1 million.
  Mercator's CFO and Controller intentionally excluded approximately 
$850,000 of those expenses.  An additional $850,000 of second quarter 
expenses was excluded largely as a result of Mercator's inadequate 
internal expense reporting controls and through inadvertence.<a></a><a href="#P67_8470" name="P67_8471">4</a>
</p><p>The Controller realized by June 2000 that revenue figures for the
 second quarter would not be high enough for the company to meet 
published analysts' earnings expectations.  During the second quarter, 
the Controller expressed concerns to the CFO that expenses were likely 
to be higher than anticipated and second quarter revenue figures were 
turning out to be lower than anticipated.  When the Controller closed 
the accounts payable system after the end of the second quarter, she 
kept track of invoices for second quarter expenses that had not been 
entered into the accounts payable system.  As second quarter expenses 
came in to the accounting department, the Controller added them to her 
list but did not include them in the financial statements she was 
preparing for the second quarter because she was concerned that, if she 
did, the company would not meet earnings expectations.  In early July 
2000, the Controller informed the CFO about her decision not to record 
certain expenses in the second quarter.  The CFO approved the 
Controller's decision, telling her not to worry about it and that there 
was an expense cushion in the budget in the fourth quarter that would 
cover those expenses.  In addition to excluding the expenses described 
above, the CFO and the Controller excluded certain second quarter 
bonusexpenses from the financial statements. The total second quarter 
expenses which the Controller and the CFO decided to exclude was 
$850,000.
</p><p>Notwithstanding the exclusion of second quarter expenses from the
 financial statements, Mercator did not meet analysts' earnings 
expectations for the second quarter.  Mercator issued an earnings 
warning after the close of the market on July 14, 2000 indicating that 
it expected pro-forma earnings per share to be $.04, which was $.04 
lower than expectations.<a></a><a href="#P72_10560" name="P72_10561">5</a>
  The preliminary figures that Mercator released on July 14, 2000 were 
misleading because they did not include the $850,000 in expenses that 
the Controller and the CFO had excluded, nor did they include the 
additional $850,000 in expenses that were excluded due to inadvertence 
and poor internal controls.  On July 20, 2000, Mercator issued a press 
release and financial statements that still did not include those second
 quarter expenses.  As a result of the excluded expenses, second quarter
 net loss, operating loss and loss per share were each understated by 
10%.<a></a><a href="#P73_11247" name="P73_11248">6</a> 
</p><p>        
</p><p><b>3. <u> Mercator's Response to the Reports of Accounting Impropriety</u></b>
</p><p>In late 1999, Mercator's Chief Executive Officer (the "CEO") 
removed certain non-financial responsibilities from the CFO.  In the 
first quarter of 2000, the CEO began an active search for a replacement 
CFO.  On August 1, 2000, the CFO was replaced by a new Chief Financial 
Officer (the "new CFO").        
</p><p>On the morning of July 20, 2000, prior to Mercator's second 
quarter earnings release, the Controller met informally with the new 
CFO.  At that meeting the Controller informed the new CFO that she had 
concerns about the recording of expenses in both the first and the 
second quarter financial statements.  When the new CFO started work on 
August 1, 2000, he began investigating the Controller's claim that the 
company's first and second quarter expenses were understated.  By August
 9, 2000, the new CFO's investigation revealed that substantial expenses
 had not been recorded in the first and second quarters.  On August 10, 
2000, the new CFO contacted Mercator's in-house counsel about the 
accounting issues and instructed him to contact outside counsel and the 
audit committee.  The new CFO also tendered his own immediate 
resignation.
</p><p>  On August 10, 2000, the company began an internal 
investigation.  On August 14, 2000, Mercator placed the CFO (who had 
previously been replaced on August 1, 2000) onadministrative leave and 
terminated his employment on August 20, 2000.  Also on August 20, 2000, 
Mercator relieved the Controller of her duties and of all responsibility
 for accounting decisions.  On August 21, 2000, Mercator announced that 
the previously released financial statements for the first and second 
quarters were inaccurate and that it had hired its outside auditors to 
conduct a special review of its systems and controls and to make 
recommendations for improvements.  The company filed an amended Form 
10-Q for the first quarter and a Form 10-Q for the second quarter 
reflecting restated results.  The restatement revealed that the first 
quarter net loss, operating loss and loss per share were each 
understated by 14%.  For the second quarter, net loss, operating loss 
and loss per share were each understated by 10%.     

</p><p><b>D. <u>VIOLATIONS</u></b>

</p><p><b>1. <u>Mercator Violated Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13 Thereunder</u></b>
	
</p><p>Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13a-13 thereunder 
require issuers of registered securities to file quarterly reports with 
the Commission.  It is implicit in this requirement that the information
 provided be accurate. <u>See</u> <u>United States v. Bilzerian</u>, 926 F.2d 1285, 1298 (2d Cir.), <u>cert. denied</u>, 502 U.S. 813 (1991); <u>SEC v. Kalvex, Inc.</u>,
 425 F. Supp. 310, 316 (S.D.N.Y. 1975).  Regulation S-X requires that 
financial statements filed with the Commission pursuant to Section 13(a)
 of the Exchange Act be prepared in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles ("GAAP") or such statements will be presumed to be
 misleading or inaccurate.  In addition, Exchange Act Rule 12b-20 
requires that these periodic reports contain all information necessary 
to ensure that statements made in them are not materially misleading.  
The issuer reporting provisions are violated when false and misleading 
reports are filed.  <u>SEC v.  Falstaff Brewing Corp.</u>, 629 F.2d 62, 
67 (D.C. Cir.  1980).  No showing of scienter is necessary to establish a
 violation of Section 13(a) or Rules 12b-20 or 13a-13.  <u>See</u> <u>SEC v. McNulty,</u> 137 F.3d 732, 740-41 (2d Cir. 1998); <u>SEC v. Savoy Industries, Inc.</u>, 587 F.2d 1149, 1167 (D.C. Cir. 1978);  <u>SEC v. Wills</u>, 472 F. Supp. 1250, 1268 (D.D.C. 1978); <u>In re Curtis L. Dally</u>, Exchange Act Rel. No. 39144, (September 29, 1997), 1997 SEC LEXIS 2026. 
</p><p>Mercator filed a Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2000 
that materially misstated the company's operating results.  Mercator's 
net loss, operating loss and loss per share were each understated by 
14%.  Accordingly, Mercator violated Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act 
and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13 thereunder.
</p><p><b>2. <u>Mercator Violated Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange   Act </u></b>
</p><p>Section 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act states, in pertinent part, 
that every reporting company must:  (A) make and keep books, records and
 accounts which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
 transactions and disposition of the assets of the issuer; and (B)devise
 and maintain a system of internal controls sufficient to provide 
reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to 
permit the preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP. 
 These provisions require an issuer to employ and supervise reliable 
personnel, to maintain reasonable assurances that transactions are 
executed as authorized, to properly record transactions on an issuer's 
books and, at reasonable intervals, to compare accounting records with 
physical assets.  <u>SEC v. World-Wide Coin Investments, Ltd.</u>, 567 F. Supp. 724, 750 (N.D. Ga. 1983).  Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) do not require a showing of scienter.  <u>Id.</u> at 751.
</p><p>Mercator violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act by 
failing to maintain accurate records concerning its expenses.  It failed
 to record quarterly expenses in the quarters in which they were 
incurred, as required by GAAP.  Accordingly, Mercator violated Section 
13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act. 
</p><p>In addition, Mercator violated Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the 
Exchange Act by failing to devise and maintain a system of internal 
controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that transactions 
are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial 
statements in conformity with GAAP.  Mercator failed to ensure that 
proper reviews and checks were in place to ensure that expenses were 
recorded in the financial reporting period during which they were 
incurred.  In particular, during the first and second quarters of 2000 
Mercator had inadequate procedures in place to ensure accurate and 
timely communication between the accounting department and other areas 
of the company, with the result that certain expenses were not 
internally reported to the accounting department until after the 
financial statements for the period had already been publicly released. 
 Accordingly, Mercator violated Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act.
</p><p align="center"><b>IV.</b> 
</p><p>In determining to accept the Offer, the Commission considered 
remedial acts promptly undertaken by Mercator and cooperation afforded 
the Commission staff.

</p><p align="center"><b>V.</b>

</p><p>In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to 
accept the Offer submitted by Mercator and to impose the 
cease-and-desist order agreed to in the Offer.
</p><p>Accordingly,  <b>IT IS HEREBY ORDERED</b>, pursuant to Section 
21C of the Exchange Act, that Mercator Software, Inc. cease and desist 
from committing or causing any violation and any future violation of 
Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and 
Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13 thereunder.
</p><p>By the Commission.
