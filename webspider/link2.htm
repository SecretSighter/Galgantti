<h1>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
<br>Washington, D.C.</h1>

<h2>Litigation Release No.  17904 / December 19, 2002

<p>Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release No. 1695 / December 19, 2002

</p><p><i>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION v. U.S. TECHNOLOGIES, INC. and C. GREGORY EARLS</i>, No. 1:02CV02495 (Robertson, J.) (D.D.C., filed December 19, 2002)

</p><p align="CENTER">SEC FILES SECURITIES FRAUD CHARGES AGAINST
<br>U.S TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND C. GREGORY EARLS </p></h2>

<p>On December 19, 2002, the Commission filed a lawsuit in federal court
 charging U.S. Technologies, Inc. ("UST"), along with its chairman and 
chief executive officer, C. Gregory Earls, with securities fraud and 
other violations.  The Commission is asking the Court to enjoin both 
defendants from violating the federal securities laws, to order Earls to
 disgorge his ill-gotten gains and pay a civil penalty, and to bar Earls
 from serving as an officer or director of any public company.   

</p><p>The Commission's complaint alleges that from June 1998 through 
August 2002, Earls misappropriated approximately $13.8 million from 
investors who believed they were giving Earls money to purchase 
preferred stock and warrants from UST.  According to the complaint, 
Earls carried out this scam through a limited liability company he 
created called USV Partners LLC.  The complaint charges that Earls 
falsely told investors in USV Partners that the entity was created 
solely to purchase and hold UST stock and warrants, and that he would 
not take any management fees.  According to the complaint, Earls lured 
more than one hundred investors into giving him more than $20 million to
 purchase UST stock and warrants through USV Partners.  Although UST 
badly needed the capital infusion, according to the complaint, Earls 
bought only a small portion of the stock he promised investors.  He then
 allegedly misappropriated $13.8 million of their money by paying 
himself $4.7 million in management fees and $9.1 million that he falsely
 classified as "Legal and Accounting" expenses.  As alleged in the 
complaint, neither UST nor Earls has ever publicly disclosed Earls' 
diversion of these investor funds. 

</p><p>The complaint further charges that Earls and UST made numerous 
materially misleading statements and omissions to cover up Earls' 
misdeeds.  For example, the complaint alleges that while touting Earls' 
supposed business experience and acumen, Earls and UST failed to 
disclose that he had previously been accused of misappropriating 
investor funds in connection with several other companies.  Earls and 
UST are also charged with failing to reveal the material weaknesses 
noted by its independent auditor concerning its internal accounting 
controls.   Most recently, according to the complaint, Earls and UST 
failed to disclose that half of its board of directors resigned in or 
about April 2002.

</p><p>The Commission's complaint charges UST with violating Section 
17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act"), Sections 
10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 
13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13.  It charges Earls with violating Securities 
Act Section 17(a), Exchange Act Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5), and 
Exchange Act Rules 10b-5 and 13b2-1.  The complaint also charges Earls 
with aiding and abetting UST's violations of Exchange Act Sections 
10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(b), and Exchange Act Rules 
10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13.

  </p><p>In a related criminal proceeding, Earls was charged with securities fraud, mail fraud, and wire fraud. <i>United States v. C. Gregory Earls</i>,
 No. 02-MAG-531 (S.D.N.Y.)  That case is being prosecuted by the United 
States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.  The 
Commission thanks the U.S. Attorney's Office, the Department of Justice,
 and the United States Postal Inspection Service for their assistance in
 the Commission's investigation of this matter, which is continuing.
