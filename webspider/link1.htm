<h2>SEC Charges Former Arthur Andersen Partner Robert A. Putnam with 
Fraud and Improper Professional Conduct in Connection with Audit Work 
for HBO &amp; Company and ebix.com, Inc.</h2>

<p>The United States Securities and Exchange Commission announced today 
that it has instituted public administrative proceedings against Robert 
A. Putnam, a former Arthur Andersen LLP partner and a certified public 
accountant, in connection with audit work he performed for two separate 
public companies, HBO &amp; Company ("HBOC") and ebix.com, inc. 
("Ebix").  The Order Instituting Public Administrative Proceedings 
Pursuant to Rule 102(e) of the Commission's Rules of Practice and 
Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities 
Act of 1933 and Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
("Order") alleges that Putnam committed or caused violations of the 
antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws while acting as 
HBOC's outside audit engagement partner.  Further, the Order alleges 
that Putnam engaged in improper professional conduct within the meaning 
of Commission Rule of Practice 102(e) during his work for HBOC and while
 the engagement partner on the Ebix audit.  </p>

<p><b>HBOC</b>.  Putnam was the audit engagement partner for HBOC during
 the time that senior management were directing a massive financial 
reporting fraud scheme.  The HBOC fraud began in 1997 and continued 
after its January 1999 merger with San Francisco-based McKesson 
Corporation, which resulted in the formation of McKesson HBOC 
Corporation ("McKesson HBOC").  When the fraud was first disclosed in 
April 1999, McKesson HBOC shares tumbled from approximately $65 to $34, a
 decline that slashed the company's market value by more than $9 
billion.  Previously, the Commission has brought fraud and other charges
 against nine former HBOC and McKesson HBOC officers and employees for 
their roles in the fraud.  </p>

<p>According to the Commission's Order, Putnam approved Arthur 
Andersen's issuance of six false quarterly review reports during 1997 
and 1998 and a false 1997 audit report on HBOC's financial statements.  
These reports were incorporated in HBOC's public filings.  Putnam knew, 
or was reckless in not knowing, that HBOC's accounting practices did not
 conform to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, and that Andersen 
did not conduct its quarterly reviews and audit in compliance with 
Generally Accepted Auditing Standards.  For instance, the Order alleges 
that Putnam knew that during the first quarter of 1997, HBOC's reported 
pretax income was overstated by 9.4 percent, in part because of 
contingences in HBOC software contracts that should have prohibited 
revenue recognition.  In subsequent periods, Putnam also knew that HBOC 
was reporting financial results that were significantly inflated, in 
part because of revenue contingencies found in side letters and HBOC's 
deliberate misuse of reserve accounts.  Although Putnam knew that HBOC 
management was using improper accounting to boost results, the Order 
alleges that he failed to stop the practices and did not bring them to 
the attention of HBOC's audit committee.   </p>

<p><b>Ebix</b>.  The Ebix matter concerns Putnam's conduct as the audit 
engagement partner for Andersen's audit of Ebix for the nine-month 
period ended December 31, 1998 ("1998 transition period").  Ebix is a 
software developer and marketer.  In connection with the confirmations 
sent to Ebix's customers during his audit work for the company, Putnam 
became aware that various customers claimed that they were entitled to 
refunds of deposits on software and would not pay certain outstanding 
invoices because they claimed the software Ebix had delivered did not 
function properly.  Despite the negative confirmations, Putnam conducted
 no further investigation of the revenue and accepted management's 
representation that the software functioned properly and the revenue was
 collectible.  Ebix subsequently restated its financials statements for 
the 1998 transition period, reducing its software revenue by $3.4 
million of a total of over $19 million in revenue the company recognized
 for the period.  The Order alleges that Putnam's conduct in connection 
with the audit constituted improper professional conduct.</p>

<p>A hearing will be scheduled before an administrative law judge to 
determine whether the allegations contained in the Order are true, to 
provide Putnam an opportunity to dispute these allegations, and to 
determine whether Putnam should be ordered to cease and desist from 
committing or causing any violations and any future violations of 
Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and whether 
Putnam should be censured, or denied the privilege or appearing or 
practicing before the Commission based upon improper professional 
conduct and willful violations, or aiding and abetting violations, of 
the federal securities laws.</p>
